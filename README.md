This is my project. It's a twitter bot that uses the twitter api and a list to randomly generate tweets or send a specific tweet from the text in a list every time the code is ran. 
I have made a menu that uses a master loop to let you send multiple tweets. 
For Api information message Brian Kiefer on slack.

If you try to send the same tweet twice in a row from the bot it returns an error.
